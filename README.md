# rov-ransceiver
Overview

This repository contains the code for the transceiver module of an Underwater Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). The transceiver is responsible for communication between the ROV and the operator's control station, ensuring data transmission and reception in an underwater environment.
Features

    Reliable and robust underwater communication.
    Customized protocols for data transmission.
    Real-time monitoring and control of the ROV.
    Compatibility with common underwater communication hardware.

Setup

    Clone this repository to your development environment.
    Install any required dependencies listed in the code documentation.
    Upload the code to the transceiver module of your ROV's microcontroller.

Usage

    Ensure the ROV's transceiver is correctly powered and connected to the control station.
    Run the code on the control station's computer.
    Follow the documentation to establish a connection with the ROV.
    Use the provided APIs to send commands and receive data from the ROV.
